Frontend Flow Overview
The frontend interacts with your smart contracts and allows users to:

Add liquidity to the pool.
Remove liquidity.
Swap tokens.
The flow involves:

Connecting a wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
Fetching data (token balances, pool state) from the blockchain.
Sending transactions (add liquidity, remove liquidity, swap) via your contracts.
Displaying real-time updates to the user.
