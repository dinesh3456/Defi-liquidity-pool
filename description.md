Project Overview:
You are tasked with developing a decentralized application (dApp) that involves deploying ERC20 tokens, creating a liquidity pool smart contract, and building a user-friendly frontend interface. This project will help us evaluate your proficiency in blockchain development, smart contract programming, and full-stack integration.

Task Details:
Deploy Two ERC20 Tokens: Create and deploy two distinct ERC20 tokens on a EVM blockchain network of your choice.
Create a Liquidity Pool Smart Contract: Develop a smart contract that facilitates a liquidity pool for the two ERC20 tokens youâ€™ve deployed.

Features to Implement:
Add Liquidity: Allow users to deposit both tokens into the pool.
Remove Liquidity: Enable users to withdraw their deposited tokens from the pool.
Swap Tokens: Implement functionality for users to swap one token for the other within the pool.

Develop a Frontend Interface:
Objective: Build a user-friendly frontend application that interacts with your smart contracts, enabling users to manage liquidity and perform token swaps.

Submission Guidelines:
Repository: Host your project on a public GitHub repository. Ensure the repository is well-structured with a clear commit history.
Documentation: Include a comprehensive README file that outlines:

- Project setup instructions.
- Detailed explanations of your smart contract architecture.
- Instructions on how to interact with the frontend.
- Any assumptions or design decisions made.
  Demo: (Optional) Provide a live demo link or a video walkthrough showcasing the application's functionality.
  Deadline: Please submit your completed task within this Friday. [17/01/2024]

Evaluation Criteria:
Functionality: The application meets all the specified requirements and functions as intended.
Code Quality: Clean, readable, and well-documented code following best practices.
Security: Implementation of security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities.
User Experience: Intuitive and responsive frontend design.
Innovation: Any additional features or improvements beyond the basic requirements
